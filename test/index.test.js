// This file will contain tests for the program. The purpose of these tests is to
// ensure that the core program logic works as expected.

// This project uses a testing library called Jest. You can learn more about Jest
// here: https://jestjs.io/.

// Test files can contain multiple tests, so long as those tests are grouped logically.
// Included below is a function and a test that makes assertions about the behaviour
// of the function. In most cases the subject of a test will be defined in a separate
// file. In this case we've defined the function and the corresponding test in the
// same file for illustrative and learning purposes.

  return "Wow, what a cool function";
